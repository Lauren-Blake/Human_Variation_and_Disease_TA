\large{\textbf{Human Variation and Disease: Discussion 1 Lesson Plan}}

\end{center}

\textbf{Before class:}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Students should have emailed you with the concepts that they found the most difficult. Prepare mini-lessons on each of these topics. For example, the year that I taught it, my students wanted help with understanding the Binomial versus Poisson, Beta random variables, and the Bivariate normal random variable. 

\item Write your name, email address, and the agenda for the class on the board. Also write any material that you will need for your mini-lessons on the board. 

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{During class:}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Students should have already made a ``first attempt'' at the problems. Go through each of the mini-lessons, alternating between teaching and saying the answer for the concept checks. When you get to a concept check, have students talk to the person next to them to get consensus about an answer and then select one member of the class to say the answer out loud. 

\item Ask students if they have any questions about the mini-lessons. 

\item Go around in a circle, having each student say the answer to a concept check (for the concept checks not reviewed earlier).

\item Ask students if they have any questions about the topics presented during class. 


\end{enumerate}
